# Exercicio SASS
## About
This is an exercise made for EBAC's HTML course I'm taking part on where we'd put our SASS knowledges into action by converting the css file from the website to scss.
> Check the [defunct css] folder to compare the previously and the currently used codes for the project's CSS!
I hope you like it!
